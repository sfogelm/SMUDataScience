#SMU Data Science Course

This repository will serve as a container for all of my assignemnts for my SMU Data Science Course.

This repository contains data from the "fivethiryeight" website.
The first part of the course has dealt with topics that are for general coding with R. The homework assignments come from SMU and usually are related to information I have learned in class, from our textbook "Reproducible Research with R and R Studio", and from exercises that were completed in the swirl module.
